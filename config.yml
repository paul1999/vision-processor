# VisionProcessor configuration

# Vision camera ID handled by this VisionProcessor instance.
# On multi camera fields the IDs have to be ordered according to camera_ids.png.

camera:
  # Camera driver type. Availability depending on libraries installed.
  # Existing: SPINNAKER (FLIR cameras), MVIMPACT (Bluefox3 cameras), OPENCV(files, v4l2 cameras)
  #driver: SPINNAKER

  # Camera exposure time in ms to adjust brightness. Higher values lead to more motion blur. Lower values lead to a darker image.
  # Camera frame rate will drop if set equal to or higher than the frame time (1 / fps_cam).
  # 0.0 = automatic exposure
  #exposure: 0.0
  # Camera gain to adjust brightness. Higher values lead to more noise. Lower values lead to a darker image.
  # Frequently changing bot identities or team colors indicate an image that is too bright (all colors becoming nearly white).
  # 0.0 = automatic gain
  #gain: 0.0
  # Camera gamma as nonlinear brightness adjustment. Only supported on SPINNAKER and OPENCV.
  # Low values reduce differences between bright and dark illuminated areas. High values increase the color contrast.
  # 1.0 = no gamma
  #gamma: 1.0
  # Camera white balance. OUTDOOR or INDOOR for auto white balance with green or gray carpet respectively.
  # (distinction between OUTDOOR and INDOOR currently only implemented for SPINNAKER backend)
  # [Blue white balance, Red white balance] for manual white balance.

  # Spinnaker camera exposure time in ms to adjust brightness. Higher values lead to more motion blur.
  # Camera framerate will drop if set equal to or higher than the frametime (1 / fps_cam).

  # Spinnaker camera gain to adjust brightness. Higher values lead to more noise.
  # 0.0 = automatic gain

  # Spinnaker camera white balance. OUTDOOR or INDOOR for auto white balance with green or gray carpet respectively.
  # [Blue white balance, Red white balance] for manual white balance.
